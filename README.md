# Pomagotchi
The Pomagotchi is a combination of digital and analog hardware to create a pomorodo timer. The device utilizes analog controls such as a potentiometor,
and analog buttons to interact with the software.

Software:
The goal is to turn the Pomodoro timer into an interactive game.  You get a pet, displayed on screen.  Every Pomodoro session, your pet requires attention.  
Interrupting a session will cause your pet to get upset with you for interrupting their activity!


This project is still under construction.
